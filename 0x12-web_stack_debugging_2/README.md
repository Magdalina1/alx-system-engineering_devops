### This project is about debugging a web stack that runs Nginx as a web server. The main goal is to learn how to run software as another user in Linux and how to configure Nginx to listen on different ports and IPs.

## Features

### This project contains the following Bash scripts that perform various debugging

	- 0-iamsomeoneelse: A script that accepts one argument
	- 1-run_nginx_as_nginx: A script that configures Nginx to run as the nginx user
	- 100-fix_in_7_lines_or_less: A shorter version of the previous script that uses some tricks and shortcuts to reduce 
	  the number of lines and characters
