# Command line for the win

I used the SFTP put command to upload the screenshot from my local machine to the sandbox environment.
I confirmed that the screenshot had been successfully transferred by checking the sandbox directory.
I pushed the screenshot with the right name (level_number.png or level_number.jpg) to GitHub, in either the PNG or JPEG format.
I created a screenshot showing that I completed at least 9 levels, and pushed it to GitHub with the name 0-first_9_tasks.png or 0-first_9_tasks.jpg.
